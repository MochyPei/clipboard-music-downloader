# Clipboard music downloader

Simple script on Batch that gets url from clipboard and automatically downloads, converts and renames media on your computer, using [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) & [ffmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg).

I wrote this with help of GPT4 for myself, it's way better and faster for me than just typing command, and renaming files.

## How it works?
You're bored from writing something to just download your favourite music?

Just add my script to your folder, copy url of your music and run it.

And you got it, just a little changes in name and you have your music on your computer.

## Dependencies
You need [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) & [ffmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg) to get this to work.
Works on Windows 10 and higher. (Or any other windows that has Powershell)
